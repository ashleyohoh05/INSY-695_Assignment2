# Tumor Area Prediction App

This Streamlit app predicts tumor area based on user input features using a Gradient Boosting Regressor model. This app predicts tumor area based on input features like radius, texture, and perimeter. It uses a Gradient Boosting Regressor trained on a dataset to provide accurate predictions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:
   ```bash'
   streamlit run app.py

## Features
> Simple interface for entering input features.
> Displays predicted tumor area based on user inputs.

## Sample Interaction
Input:
- Feature 1: 2.5
- Feature 2: 1.7
- Feature 3: 3.2

Output:
- Predicted Tumor Area: 115.67
